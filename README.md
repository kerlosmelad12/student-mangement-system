# student-mangement-system

# This project is an OOP Python project using SQLite for the database and a GUI for the frontend. In this project, the admin can access the courses that students register for by adding or removing courses, and the same applies to students. Students can register for courses and select teachers for their registered courses using an ID. More details about the project can be found in the SRS document.
